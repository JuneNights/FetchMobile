### Summary: Include screen shots or a video of your app highlighting its features

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
I focused on thread safety, ensuring that UI updates are done on the main thread, view is not handling business logic.
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I took almost 6 hours to complete this task, I added some additional features such as searching, sorting, and user defaults.
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
I could have customized the UI more if I had used a ScrollView instead of a List, but that means I would have created a custom refresh functionality. So I kept the List instead.
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I had to look up a short tutorial about XCTest since in my experience that has not been a big part of my previous work or at all so I had to re-learn again quickly.
### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
